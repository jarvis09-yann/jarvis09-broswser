## Browse between the pages of the websites on my domain.

This is a simple homepage to my webpage where users can go to the different websites hosted on my domain.

## How does this work ?

The page is using HTML/CSS and vanilla JS. No need for anything else because the only purpose of the page is to link to other pages.

## Can i use this for my website ?

Absolutely! You are free to use this on your website. If you made improvements to my (awful) code a PR would be greatly appreciated!
